Welcome back, guys! Long time, no see. I've switched from dedicated hosting
to having my site on GitHub. There are just so many benefits of this:

* GitHub is taking care of the infrastructure, including
	* Hosting
	* SSL
	* Security
* All content is Open Source and for everyone to see and improve (highly unlikely, but you never know!)


By eliminating the need to watch my server I hope to be able to focus on writing.


If you wanted to set up a blog like this, sign up for a GitHub account
(it's free!) and consult [GitHub's Help](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)
for further information on *GitHub pages*.
