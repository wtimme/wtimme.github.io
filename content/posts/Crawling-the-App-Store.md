On this page, I collect my research results for App Store crawlers.
The page's goal is to act as a starting point for people who want to crawl the
App Store and aggregate information from it.

| [Shopify app store](https://www.kaggle.com/usernam3/shopify-app-store) | A dataset on Kaggle. Not directly related to _app_ app stores, but might be worth taking a look at in regards to how the data is stored. |
